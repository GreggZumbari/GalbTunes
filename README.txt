Hello user, and thank you for checking out this project.
This project was made for Mr. Gabraith's C++ Programming class at Sunset High
School.

China.cpp is the main class, and the .cpp and .h files by the names Media,
Game, Music, and Movie are all necessary as well.
If you are using the g++ compiler like I am, then the following command will
compile it correctly:

g++ -o China.exe China.cpp Media.cpp Game.cpp Music.cpp Movie.cpp

That's it! For more info on the program itself, please see the header comment
within China.cpp.
